## Core Features:

- Screenshot Analysis: User uploads a screenshot of a design, and AI identifies key elements like layout, typography, and color schemes.
- Style Extraction: AI extracts style attributes (colors, fonts, spacing) and outputs as text, and prepares this to be loaded as variables.
- Palette Generation: Suggests a base color palette using a combination of identified prominent and complementary color via AI analysis.
- Typography Suggestion: Suggests typography pairings from the list of implemented fonts based on visual style of design, using AI to decide if the text warrants a serif/sans-serif combination.
- Style Guide Export: Generate a downloadable style guide document (.txt) with color codes, font names, sizes, and spacing information, prepared as a set of javascript/css variables for front-end application development.
- UI Preview: Display the original image and a basic mockup version rendered in the extracted style, for quick comparison.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#A020F0) to reflect sophistication and creativity.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), a desaturated tint of the primary color, provides a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Pink (#FF69B4), an analogous color, adds a vibrant highlight to interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern and neutral aesthetic.
- Use simple, outlined icons in shades of purple and pink to maintain a consistent visual theme.
- Maintain a two-column layout for a balanced distribution of input and output areas.
- Use subtle transitions for loading states to provide a smooth user experience.
